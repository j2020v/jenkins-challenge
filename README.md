# Jenkins Challenge ðŸ”§ðŸ’»

Hey guys :) We have a nice Challenge for you.

Here is the situation: Our Jenkins box on AWS (Amazon Web Services) isn't working.

But no fear! You already built your own Jenkins!

#### The weekend Challenge is:

Create your own Jenkins Box locally (with your vagrant up)
Set up a Webhooks from GitHub to trigger a build in Jenkins

#### The Challenge will include:

   - generating SSH keys to authenticate Webhooks

   - Opening up your laptop & virtual Machine to receive said Webhook

   - Allow access (firewall)

#### Make sure you set:
```
{ GitHub }

    |
    |  [SSH, firewall, fixed IP address]
    |
  \ | /
   \ /

[ My computer ] | [[ Jenkins 192]]

```
We want Jenkins to trigger a build (we are not actually going to build anything) when a change happens in the GitHub repo.

#### Create a instance of Jenkins ( done - vagrant up)
  - make sure it has plugin for GitHub

#### Generate keys so it can communicate securely with GitHub
  - Figure out how GitHub will communicate with the machine that is INSIDE you machine

#### Fire walls, IP addresses

Environment Variable
setting: creating one: MY_VAR=hello

Calling:

echo $MY_VAR

hello

#### Running programs to be saved as variables:
Example:

 - FPaiva@lt-rich-w133 MINGW64 ~ $ DIR=$(pwd)

 - FPaiva@lt-rich-w133 MINGW64 ~ $ echo $DIR /c/Users/FPaiva

 - FPaiva@lt-rich-w133 MINGW64 ~ $ ANOTHER_VAR=$(ls dat)

 - FPaiva@lt-rich-w133 MINGW64 ~ $ echo $ANOTHER_VAR ntuser.dat.LOG1 ntuser.dat.LOG2
